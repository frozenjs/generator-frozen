## Development

During development, an error will be thrown because `dist/game.js` doesn't exist

However, we check to see if it is loaded and use the dojo loader if it isn't

We also note in the console that is happening

During development, work in the `src/` directory and make small modules

You can start a development server with linting and auto-reload using the `grunt` command in your terminal, which will open your default browser to 0.0.0.0:8000

Your browser will auto-reload when you make changes to files

## Building

Once you are ready to deploy your project, you can build with the `grunt build` command

This command will crawl your dependency tree, starting with `src/game.js` and build a single file `dist/game.js.uncompressed.js`

It will also minify your file with Google Closure Compiler into `dist/game.js`

You shouldn't have to make any changes to your `index.html` for this file to start working

## Removing Build and/or Dependencies

You can remove the files generated by the `grunt dojo` (`dist/` and `libs/`) by running `grunt clean:dist`

You can remove `deps/` and `node_modules/` by running `grunt clean:deps`

You can remove `dist/`, `libs/`, `deps/`, and `node_modules/` by running `grunt clean:all`
